# WPF-EF_Project_-Modnar
## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to create a small dungeon RPG. 
The play creates a party of 4 and then can fight monsters, picked randomly from a database of monsters.

# Sprint 1
## Sprint 1 Goals
Basic functioning game with monster and players that can attack each other

## Sprint 1 Retrospective
I'm quite happy with the work I have done in my first sprint. I have a very basic form of my game, Monsters and players are creatable and they can attack each other.
The next goal will be to create a turn based system and then to implement a database so monster data can be randomised.

## Sprint 1 Review
* The main point taken from the review is that my scrum board needs some work. Epics need to be split up more and kept in project backlog til completion. Testing doesn't need to be a User Story as User stories are to be tested anyway. 
* Work that has been completed has looks good, however more feed back for the user is required in battle. To do this i'll be adding a turn counter so the user has some feedback that their action has happened.
* My file system also needs to organised with folders for each seperate layer in MVC format.
* Testing also needs to be orgnaised with seperate files for each class i'm testing
* Sprint 2's main focus will be the creation of the database layer, and a to create a better user experience by supplying more feedback

# Sprint 2
## Sprint 2 Goals
* Link up a Database of monsters and players to the rest of the project
* Create a well display User Interface which, gives good feedback on the action undertaken.

# Sprint 2 Retrospective
I'm very happy with my work this sprint as I have implemented the databases I needed for my game to work. Special thanks to Jia for assisting me with this

# Sprint 2 Review
* Most of my Sprint goals were met in this Sprint
* The used needs more options on what they can do so there is more gameplay to the game other than just pressing the attack button

# Sprint 3
## Sprint 3 Goals
* Create and choose player characters within the game
* Give player character more choices. Like Taunt and heal.
* Defeat and score screen
